Dataset Collection and Augmentation for Fish Disease Detection

1. Dataset Collection: In this research, a dataset of fish images was sourced from publicly available resources to train and evaluate a deep learning-based fish disease detection system. The dataset was collected from two primary sources:
   . Kaggle Dataset: The dataset titled "Fresh Water Fish Disease Dataset" by Utpol Kantidas (n.d.) provides a collection of images depicting both healthy and infected freshwater fish. This dataset can be accessed via the following link: [Kaggle - Fresh Water Fish Disease Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utpolkantidas/fresh-water-fish-disease-dataset)
   . GitHub Repository: Additionally, a code repository titled "Fish Disease Detection" by Enza30 (n.d.) was used to leverage pre-existing models and techniques for fish disease classification. This repository can be accessed at GitHub - https://github.com/Enza30/FishDisease
